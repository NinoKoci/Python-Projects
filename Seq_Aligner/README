Nino Koci HW2 Part 2

1. Introduction:
This is a global alignmnet for CS-167 Homework 2

2. How to run this code:

i. install packages:
    - install numpy as np
    - install sys

ii. Use a command console and insert:
    $ python align.py < insert_file > output
    This format will run in any 

iii. Scoring 
    Inital scoring paramters are set to M=4, m=-2, g=-2
    To change the scoring parameters
        go to: def main()
            align = GlobalSeqAlignment(x,y, 4,-2,-2)
               The class is formated as GlobalSeqAlignment(x,y, M,m,g)
                change paramters by M=match score, m= missmatch score, g=gap pennalty 

iv. Potential issues:
    - Make sure the FASTA files inserted can be opened as a list of strings
    - Make sure sequnces compared are both >0
    - Make sure to include the file extensions for the file
